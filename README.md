# Puppies + Babies

## Objectives
+ Link jQuery to HTML file
+ Use jQuery to manipulate HTMl

## Instructions
Everyone loves a good gif of puppies and kids doing funny things, so let's use jQuery to make sure we have a good one on our page.

We'll be coding our solution in `html/index.html`.

+ Link jQuery to `index.html` using the following link `http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.3/jquery.min.js`.

+ Before the closing body tag, use jQuery to append this gif (https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-verified/painting-with-dog.gif) to the div with the ID `image`.
